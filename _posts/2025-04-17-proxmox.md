# **Proxmox**
![proxmox_logo](../assets/images/proxmox/proxmox_logo.png)


Heres a guide to help those looking to install Proxmox. Proxmox is a super handy tool if you're running a homelab or just like messing around with virtual machines at home. It lets you run multiple operating systems on one physical machine using either full virtual machines or lightweight containers. The best part is it has a clean web interface, so you can manage everything from your browser â€” start, stop, clone VMs, take snapshots, and even back them up. You can also set up storage how you like and run different setups for testing or learning without needing a bunch of separate computers. And since it's free and open-source, it's great for DIY projects without spending a ton.

## Why You Should Use <u>Proxmox</u> ##
I use Proxmox because it makes it really easy to run and manage multiple virtual machines or containers on one computer. Itâ€™s perfect for my home lab and testing out different setups without needing a bunch of extra hardware â€” plus, itâ€™s free and the web interface is super user-friendly.

## My setup
I set up Proxmox on my beelink NUC to create a compact yet powerful virtualization environment for my home network. The process was straightforward: I installed Proxmox directly onto the NUC, which is connected to my home network via Ethernet for stable access. After installation, I configured the web interface to manage virtual machines and containers seamlessly. This setup has been perfect for running a homelab, testing new software, and experimenting with different operating systems without needing additional hardware.
