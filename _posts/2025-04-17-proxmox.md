# **Proxmox**
![proxmox_logo](../assets/images/proxmox/proxmox_logo.png)
Heres a guide to help those looking to install Proxmox. Proxmox is a super handy tool if you're running a homelab or just like messing around with virtual machines at home. It lets you run multiple operating systems on one physical machine using either full virtual machines or lightweight containers. The best part is it has a clean web interface, so you can manage everything from your browser — start, stop, clone VMs, take snapshots, and even back them up. You can also set up storage how you like and run different setups for testing or learning without needing a bunch of separate computers. And since it's free and open-source, it's great for DIY projects without spending a ton.

## Why You Should Use <u>Proxmox</u>##
I use Proxmox because it makes it really easy to run and manage multiple virtual machines or containers on one computer. It’s perfect for my home lab and testing out different setups without needing a bunch of extra hardware — plus, it’s free and the web interface is super user-friendly.

## My setup
This will vary, but overall should be consistent. I decided to run this locally on my Windows 11, but inside my Ubuntu WSL. If interested in installing wsl-subsystem for Linux on Windows check out my [post.](https://crtcards1.github.io)

### <u>Step 1: Update and install <b>yt-dlp</b></u>
Grab the latest Ruby update, using homebrew. If 

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y yt-dlp
```

Thats it, now you have it installed and ready to go. I am only focusing on audio but it can download video as well. There are a lot of options that I am sure you'd be able to find more advanced write-ups on. I simply wanted to pull some audio from videos and save into mp3 format. 

```bash
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 URL
```

Thats it, now it'll start downloading and you'll see your saved mp3. Note, my WSL hangs up for a second at the end so I just press enter and then it gives the terminal back.

If you want to test it quickly from the terminal, use mpg123.

```bash
sudo apt install mpg123 -y
mpg123 Name_of_File.mp3
```

You can also use it to download playlist. Simply put the playlist URL and not the individual video URL at the end. Thats it!.
