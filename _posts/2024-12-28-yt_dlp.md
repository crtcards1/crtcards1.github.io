# **yt-dlp**

This is a guide I built that I thought would be helpful in utilizing a tool that was not designed by me. I am in no way affiliated or approve of using the tool for copyrighting purposes. 

## Why You Should Use <u>yt-dlp</u>##
yt-dlp is a powerful command-line tool designed to download videos and audio from various online platforms, most notably YouTube

## What is yt_dlp and why did you choose it?

## My setup
This will vary, but overall should be consistent. I decided to run this locally on my Windows 11, but inside my Ubuntu WSL. If interested in installing wsl-subsystem for Linux on Windows check out my [post.](https://crtcards1.github.io)

### <u>Step 1: Update and install <b>yt-dlp</b></u>
Grab the latest Ruby update, using homebrew. If 

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y yt-dlp
```

Thats it, now you have it installed and ready to go. I am only focusing on audio but it can download video as well. There are a lot of options that I am sure you'd be able to find more advanced write-ups on. I simply wanted to pull some audio from videos and save into mp3 format. 

```bash
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 URL
```

Thats it, now it'll start downloading and you'll see your saved mp3. Note, my WSL hangs up for a second at the end so I just press enter and then it gives the terminal back.

If you want to test it quickly from the terminal, use mpg123.

```bash
sudo apt install mpg123 -y
mpg123 Name_of_File.mp3
```

You can also use it to download playlist. Simply put the playlist URL and not the individual video URL at the end. Thats it!.
